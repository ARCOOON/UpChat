    Generate Keys: Each user generates their public-private key pair.
    Key Exchange: Users exchange public keys with each other through a secure channel (e.g., HTTPS or a QR code scan).
    Encrypt Messages: When sending a message, the sender encrypts the message using the recipient's public key.
    Decrypt Messages: The recipient decrypts the received message using their private key.
    Secure Key Management: Keep the private keys securely stored on the user's device, and never share them with others.
